  <p class = "info" > Too Good To Be True is a short film about happiness. Inspired by aesthetic youtubers who combine lo-fi music with calming visuals, Too Good To Be True perfectly encaptures that giddy feeling we have when we are hanging out with friends, or relaxing, or exploring the city. But sometimes happiness is too good to be true, as the title of the film suggests. Sometimes happiness is fleeting. Sometimes it is only for a moment. Then poof! It is gone. Too Good To Be True highlights this momentary nature of happiness, but also emphasises the importance of capturing these moments, so that in instances where we are feeling lonely or sad or useless, we can refer back to these memories to cheer ourselves up. </p>
